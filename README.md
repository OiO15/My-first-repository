I am a marine engineer with growing interest in coding. I want to learn because this field excites me and encourages me. I believe with dedictaion and proper endeavour I can become really good at it. At present I am pursuing my Maters in Ship Technology and Offshore Engineering from Polytechnic Gdansk in Poland.
